Hi, this script is for you if you:

* Use VS Code editor, and
* you are using the command line to create new scripts, and
* want to create the new script from a template, and
* open it in the currently running instance of VS Code for the given directory, or
* make the script executable as it is created.

For convenience, this script also opens existing files in VS Code. See the
:doc:`usage` section for more details. xxx
