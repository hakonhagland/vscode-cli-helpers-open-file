Introduction
============

Hi, this script is for you if you:

* Use VS Code as your primary editor, and
* You are using the command line to create new scripts, and
* Want to create the new script from a template, and
* Open it in the currently running instance of VS Code for the given directory, or
* Make the script executable as it is created.

For convenience, this script can also open existing files in VS Code. See the
:doc:`usage` section for more details.
