Introduction
============

This script makes it easier to create terminal aliases to quickly create new scripts
or files from templates and open them in the VS Code editor. It is especially useful if you:

* You are using the command line to create new scripts, and
* want to create the new script from a template, and
* open it in the currently running instance of VS Code for the given directory, and
* optionally, make the script executable as it is created.

For convenience, this script also opens existing files in VS Code.

.. note::
    Although the script can be used directly to do the above, it would typically involve
    too much typing to make it really useful.
    Instead, the script is designed to be used in conjunction with
    terminal aliases. This way, you can create new scripts with a single short command
    involving only a minimal set of keystrokes: the alias name (you would want to make this name
    as short as possible) and the filename. See the :doc:`alias` section for more details.

See the
:doc:`usage` section for more details.
